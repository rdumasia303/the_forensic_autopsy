## 🧪 WHAT IS THIS EXPERIMENT?

This repository is **six experiments running simultaneously**:

1. **Technical**: Can one person + AI build professional policy analysis in hours?
2. **Epistemological**: What happens when AI trained on economic discourse analyzes a budget?
3. **Communication**: Can games teach fiscal policy better than articles?
4. **Institutional**: What does this mean for think tanks and policy journalism?
5. **Transparency**: Does publishing your own critique provide rhetorical immunity?
6. **Reflexivity**: Can AI meaningfully critique its own outputs?

**For the full experimental framework, read [DEEP_ANALYSIS.md](./DEEP_ANALYSIS.md)**—which is itself part of the experiment.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER

**This site may contain errors.**

The calculators, marginal rate computations, and fiscal projections were built by AI systems (Claude Opus 4.5, GPT-5.1, Gemini 3.0 Pro) based on OBR data. While we've tried to be accurate, **we welcome corrections**.

If you find a calculation error:
1. Open an issue with the specific error
2. Cite the source that contradicts our math
3. We'll fix it and credit you

**We are not trying to deceive. We are trying to illuminate.**

## 🤖 A Note on How This Was Built

### The Creators

This site was built by:

| Entity | Role |
|--------|------|
| **One Human** | Prompting, editorial direction, honesty seeking |
| **Claude Opus 4.5** | Primary code generation, analysis, this README |
| **GPT-5.1** | Cross-verification, alternative framings |
| **Gemini 3.0 Pro** | Initial analysis, data parsing |

### The Process

The human wrote **zero lines of code**.

The prompts were variations of:

> *"Analyze this OBR document. Find the issues. Consider what alternatives could have been done. Then wow the shit out of me and try to be as factual and as satirical as possible."*

That's it. Everything you see—the design, the games, the copy, the analysis—emerged from that prompt hitting 200 pages of government data.

### Why This Matters

**The human did not write the content. The LLMs did.**

But here's the uncomfortable truth: the LLMs were trained on human knowledge. The "atmosphere" they drew from—the economic arguments, the satirical framing, the design patterns—all of that came from decades of human thought about fiscal policy, inequality, and political communication.

So who wrote this? 

The honest answer: **Everyone and no one.**

The LLMs synthesized existing arguments. The human pointed them at the data. The result is... this.

## 🏛️ On Being "Non-Political"

**This site is wildly political.**

But here's the thing: *we didn't make it political. The data did.*

When the OBR's own documents show:
- A 68% marginal tax rate for Universal Credit claimants
- £67 billion extracted via frozen thresholds
- Capital gains taxed at 24% while work is taxed at 45%+
- "Get Britain Working" targeting 1 million people when only 900k vacancies exist

...the satire writes itself.

### Our Actual Position

We are not Labour. We are not Conservative. We are not Reform. We are not Lib Dem.

We are **exhausted by a political system that**:
- Won't be truthful about trade-offs
- Won't explain the math to voters
- Won't treat citizens as intelligent adults
- Hides tax rises behind frozen thresholds
- Calls itself "pro-worker" while taxing work at 68%

**If any party proposed:**
- Equalizing CGT with income tax
- A Land Value Tax
- Transparent marginal rate calculations on payslips
- Indexing thresholds to inflation automatically

...we would praise them. None have. So we critique all of them equally.

### The Bias We Acknowledge

The human who prompted this is clearly:
- Angry about fiscal drag
- Skeptical of both major parties
- Sympathetic to wealth taxation
- Frustrated by institutional opacity

These biases shaped the prompts. The prompts shaped the outputs. We're telling you this upfront so you can weight accordingly.

## 🎮 The Game Has Changed (That's The Point)

Here's what this experiment demonstrated:

**One person with AI assistance just:**
- Parsed a 200-page government document
- Built interactive calculators
- Created 4 playable educational games
- Designed a professional-grade website
- Wrote comprehensive policy analysis
- Published self-criticism alongside the work
- Documented the entire process as an experiment

**In hours. Not months. Hours.**

This is not a flex. This is **Experiment #4: Institutional Obsolescence**.

### The Finding

If we can do this, so can anyone. The era of institutional gatekeeping over policy analysis is ending. Think tanks, media organizations, government communications teams—you are no longer the only ones who can make this stuff legible.

### The Implication

This is a good thing. Democracy requires informed citizens. Informed citizens require accessible information. For too long, policy has been hidden behind:
- 200-page documents no one reads
- Jargon that excludes normal people
- Partisan framing from both sides
- Media that oversimplifies for clicks

**AI changes this.**

Not because AI is smart. But because AI can translate—from bureaucratic to human, from spreadsheet to story, from policy to game.

We hope this site makes you angry. But more importantly, we hope it makes you **informed**.

And then we hope you build something better.
